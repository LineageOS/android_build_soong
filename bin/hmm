Run "m help" for help with the build system itself.

Invoke ". build/envsetup.sh" from your shell to add the following functions to your environment:
- lunch:      lunch <product_name>-<release_type>-<build_variant>
              Selects <product_name> as the product to build, and <build_variant> as the variant to
              build, and stores those selections in the environment to be read by subsequent
              invocations of 'm' etc.
- tapas:      tapas [<App1> <App2> ...] [arm|x86|arm64|x86_64] [eng|userdebug|user]
              Sets up the build environment for building unbundled apps (APKs).
- banchan:    banchan <module1> [<module2> ...] \\
                      [arm|x86|arm64|riscv64|x86_64|arm64_only|x86_64only] [eng|userdebug|user]
              Sets up the build environment for building unbundled modules (APEXes).
- croot:      Changes directory to the top of the tree, or a subdirectory thereof.
- m:          Makes from the top of the tree.

- mmm:        Builds and installs all of the modules in the supplied directories, and their
              dependencies.
              To limit the modules being built use the syntax: mmm dir/:target1,target2.
- mma:        Same as 'mm'

- gomod:      Go to the directory containing a module.
- pathmod:    Get the directory containing a module.
- outmod:     Gets the location of a module's installed outputs with a certain extension.
- dirmods:    Gets the modules defined in a given directory.
- installmod: Adb installs a module's built APK.
- refreshmod: Refresh list of modules for allmod/gomod/pathmod/outmod/installmod.
- syswrite:   Remount partitions (e.g. system.img) as writable, rebooting if necessary.
